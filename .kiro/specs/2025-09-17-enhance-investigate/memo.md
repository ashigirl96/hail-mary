### Example 1: New Topic Investigation
```
/hm:investigate

> üîç What would you like to investigate?
> [Provide specific technical question or area]

[STOP AND WAIT]

User: "JWT authentication implementation"

> üöÄ Investigation Plan for "JWT Authentication":
> [Parallel agents launch...]

> üìù Investigation saved to <kiro_investigation_path>
> Topic: "JWT Authentication" (Section #1)
> Confidence: High (90%)

> üîÑ Continue investigating "JWT Authentication"?

User: Y, what about refresh token rotation?

> üìù Updated investigation for "JWT Authentication"
> Added findings about refresh token rotation
> Confidence: High (92%)

> üîÑ Continue investigating "JWT Authentication"?

User: done

> ‚úÖ Investigation complete
> ‚Ä¢ Topics investigated: 1
> ‚Ä¢ Overall confidence: High (92%)
```

### Example 2: Resume Existing Topic
```
/hm:investigate --topic "JWT Authentication" --for requirements

> üìù Resuming existing topic "JWT Authentication" from investigation.md
> Previous confidence: High (92%)

> üöÄ Continuing investigation for "JWT Authentication":
> [Parallel agents focus on gaps/updates...]

> üìù Updated investigation for "JWT Authentication"
> Topic: "JWT Authentication" (Section #1 - Updated)
> Confidence: High (95%)

> üîÑ Continue investigating "JWT Authentication"?

User: done

> ‚úÖ Investigation complete
> ‚Ä¢ Topics investigated: 1 (resumed)
> ‚Ä¢ Overall confidence: High (95%)
> ‚Ä¢ Updated: requirements.md (Technical Requirements section)
```

### Example 3: Multiple Separate Investigations
```
# First investigation
/hm:investigate

> üîç What would you like to investigate?

User: "API rate limiting"

[Investigation process...]

> üîÑ Continue investigating "API Rate Limiting"?

User: done

> ‚úÖ Investigation complete
> ‚Ä¢ Topics investigated: 1
> ‚Ä¢ Overall confidence: High (85%)

# Second investigation (new command)
/hm:investigate

> üîç What would you like to investigate?

User: "caching strategy"

> üöÄ Investigation Plan for "Caching Strategy":
> [New parallel investigation...]

> üìù Investigation saved to <kiro_investigation_path>
> Topic: "Caching Strategy" (Section #2)
> Confidence: Medium (75%)

> üîÑ Continue investigating "Caching Strategy"?

User: done

> ‚úÖ Investigation complete
> ‚Ä¢ Topics investigated: 1
> ‚Ä¢ Overall confidence: Medium (75%)

# Third investigation (resuming first topic)
/hm:investigate --topic "API Rate Limiting"

> üìù Resuming existing topic "API Rate Limiting" from investigation.md
> Previous confidence: High (85%)

[Continue investigation with new angle...]
```

### Example 4: Investigation Guided by Steering
````
/hm:investigate

> üîç What would you like to investigate?

User: "How to query production database for users table id=123 name field?"

> üöÄ Investigation Plan for "Production Database Query":
>
> Using steering guidance from `bigquery` type:
> - Focus on EXTERNAL_QUERY patterns for Cloud SQL
> - Check security best practices
> - Look for performance optimization patterns
>
> [Parallel agents launch with steering-informed focus...]

> üìù Investigation saved to investigation.md
> Topic: "Production Database Query" (Section #1)
> Confidence: High (92%)
> **Guided by**: steering:bigquery (EXTERNAL_QUERY patterns)
>
> ### Summary
> Found optimal approach using BigQuery EXTERNAL_QUERY for Cloud SQL production access
>
> ### Evidence
> **From Codebase (src/services/data_access.ts:89)**:
> ```typescript
> // Existing pattern for production queries
> const query = `SELECT name FROM
>   EXTERNAL_QUERY('projects/prod-project/locations/asia-northeast1/connections/prod-mysql',
>   'SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 123')`;
> ```
>
> **From Context7 (BigQuery documentation)**:
> - EXTERNAL_QUERY syntax for Cloud SQL connections
> - Security: Always use read-only credentials for production
> - Performance: Batch queries to minimize round-trips
>
> ### Recommendations
> 1. Use EXTERNAL_QUERY pattern from BigQuery to access production Cloud SQL
> 2. Ensure read-only access credentials are configured
> 3. Follow existing implementation pattern in data_access.ts
>
> ### Investigation Notes
> - **Steering Applied**: Used `bigquery` type patterns to identify EXTERNAL_QUERY as the appropriate solution

> üîÑ Continue investigating "Production Database Query"?
