# Product Overview

**Hail-Mary** - A sophisticated Rust CLI application for Memory MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and Kiro project specification management.

## Product Overview

Hail-Mary provides intelligent memory management for AI models with full-text search capabilities, multilingual support, and a comprehensive CLI interface for technical knowledge storage and retrieval. It bridges the gap between AI model interactions and persistent project knowledge through two primary systems: Memory MCP for database-driven knowledge storage and Kiro steering for file-based context management.

## Core Features

- **Memory MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for AI integration with structured knowledge storage
- **Full-Text Search**: SQLite FTS5 with Japanese tokenization support for multilingual content
- **Kiro Specification Management**: Complete project specification lifecycle with templates and interactive TUI
- **Steering System**: File-based context management for version-controllable project knowledge
- **Claude Code Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code through system prompts and specifications
- **Multilingual Support**: Native Japanese text processing with optimized search algorithms
- **Clean Architecture**: 4-layer hexagonal architecture for maintainability and testing
- **Anthropic API Client**: OAuth authentication and API client for Claude models

## Target Use Case

### Primary Use Cases
1. **AI Model Context Management**: Persistent technical knowledge storage for AI interactions
2. **Project Specification Management**: Complete spec-driven development workflow with documentation templates
3. **Technical Knowledge Base**: Searchable repository of development insights, patterns, and decisions
4. **Claude Code Enhancement**: Rich context provision for development sessions

### Specific Scenarios
- Development teams maintaining technical knowledge across sessions
- AI-assisted development with persistent project context
- Spec-driven development with structured documentation workflows
- Multilingual development teams requiring Japanese text search
- Projects requiring both database-driven and file-based knowledge management

## Key Value Proposition

### Unique Benefits
- **Dual Knowledge Systems**: Both database-driven (Memory MCP) and file-based (Steering) knowledge management
- **AI-First Design**: Built specifically for AI model integration with MCP protocol
- **Specification-Driven Development**: Complete workflow from specs to implementation with Claude Code integration
- **Multilingual Excellence**: Superior Japanese text search and processing capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: Clean CLI with interactive TUI components and comprehensive testing
- **Architectural Quality**: Production-ready Rust implementation with hexagonal architecture
- **Future-Proof**: Extensible design supporting additional memory types and MCP features

### Differentiators
- Native MCP protocol implementation rather than custom solutions
- File-based steering system complementing database storage
- Professional CLI application with proper TTY management
- Comprehensive testing including integration and multilingual scenarios
- OAuth integration for Anthropic API access
