⏺ Looking at the current steering configuration, I need to:

1. Create a backup first
2. Launch a Task agent to investigate all 4 steering types sequentially
3. Collect results and apply corrections/updates as needed

Let me start by creating a backup and then launching the investigation.

⏺ Bash(hail-mary steering backup)
⎿  ✅ Created backup '2025-09-13-01-25' with 4 files

⏺ 📦 Creating backup of current steering files...
✅ Created backup '2025-09-13-01-25' with 4 files

Now I'll launch the Task agent to investigate all steering types sequentially:

⏺ Task(Investigate steering types)
⎿  Done (22 tool uses · 84.8k tokens · 2m 23.4s)

⏺ 🚀 Launching investigation for 4 steering types...

Types to investigate:
• product - Product overview and value proposition
• tech - Technical stack and development environment• structure - Code organization and project structure patterns
• prompt-engineering - Claude Code command patterns and best practices

[Task agent processing each type sequentially...]
