## Executive Summary

After extensive analysis through 30 iterations of critique→proposal cycles, this structure achieves optimal separation of concerns with 10 clearly defined tags, each answering exactly ONE question.

## Final Structure

```xml
<kiro-spec-driven>
  <!-- Foundation Layer (WHY) -->
  <kiro-philosophy>      <!-- System purpose & core beliefs -->
  <kiro-principles>      <!-- Universal laws & rules -->

  <!-- Orchestration Layer (HOW) -->
  <kiro-hub>            <!-- tasks.md as central temporal database -->
  <kiro-patterns>       <!-- User input → action recognition -->
  <kiro-workflows>      <!-- Document state transitions & operations -->
  <kiro-gates>          <!-- Validation & blocking conditions -->
  <kiro-nudges>         <!-- Suggestions & recommendations -->

  <!-- Document Layer (WHAT) -->
  <kiro-requirements>   <!-- requirements.md structure & template -->
  <kiro-investigation>  <!-- investigation.md structure & template -->
  <kiro-design>        <!-- design.md structure & template -->
</kiro-spec-driven>
```

## Critical Improvements Over idea3.md

### 1. Clearer Layer Separation
- **Foundation**: Pure philosophy and principles (no behaviors)
- **Orchestration**: All coordination logic (no document specifics)
- **Document**: Pure structure and templates (no orchestration rules)

### 2. Single Responsibility Achievement
Each tag answers exactly ONE question:
- `<kiro-philosophy>`: "Why does this system exist?"
- `<kiro-principles>`: "What rules always apply?"
- `<kiro-hub>`: "How does tasks.md manage state?"
- `<kiro-patterns>`: "What user input triggers what?"
- `<kiro-workflows>`: "What operations happen when?"
- `<kiro-gates>`: "What blocks what?"
- `<kiro-nudges>`: "What to suggest next?"
- `<kiro-requirements>`: "How is requirements.md structured?"
- `<kiro-investigation>`: "How is investigation.md structured?"
- `<kiro-design>`: "How is design.md structured?"

### 3. Resolved Naming Issues
- Replaced vague "coordination" with specific "orchestration"
- Changed abstract terms to domain-specific ones
- Used "workflows" instead of splitting "protocol" and "protocol actions"

## Tag Content Distribution

### `<kiro-philosophy>` (~25 lines)
**Content**: Core philosophy statements
- NO Linear Workflow principle
- Reactive Pattern-Based Orchestration
- Evidence-Based Decisions
- Natural Language Interface
**Remove**: "Your Role" section (moves to principles)

### `<kiro-principles>` (~40 lines)
**Content**: Universal operational rules
- Claude-Exclusive Management
- Update Tasks.md FIRST rule
- Link Everything requirement
- Evidence Chain principle
- One Line Rule for timeline
- Your Role (operational behaviors)

### `<kiro-hub>` (~60 lines)
**Content**: tasks.md special role
- Temporal Database concept
- State Tracking Structure
- Required Investigations format
- Timeline format
- Document Format Example
**Remove**: Update timing rules (moves to workflows)

### `<kiro-patterns>` (~40 lines)
**Content**: Pattern recognition only
- Pattern → Action Mapping table
- Recognition rules
- Language-agnostic triggers
- Context-aware variations

### `<kiro-workflows>` (~100 lines)
**Content**: Timing + Operations combined
- BEFORE/AFTER protocol
- Post-Requirements operations
- Post-Investigation operations
- Post-Design operations
- State transition sequences
**Key**: This combines timing WITH specific operations

### `<kiro-gates>` (~30 lines)
**Content**: Pure validation
- Design without requirements → Block
- Design without 100% investigation → Block
- Investigation without topics → Warning
- Missing evidence → Warning

### `<kiro-nudges>` (~40 lines)
**Content**: User guidance only
- After Requirements suggestions
- During Investigation suggestions
- After Design suggestions
- State-based recommendations

### `<kiro-requirements>` (~100 lines)
**Content**: Document structure only
- PRD template
- Bug Report template
- Section requirements
**Remove**: Orchestration rules

### `<kiro-investigation>` (~60 lines)
**Content**: Document structure only
- Append-only rules
- Topic structure
- Domain-specific styles
**Remove**: Validation checks

### `<kiro-design>` (~120 lines)
**Content**: Document structure only
- Design template
- Evidence requirements
- As-Is/To-Be format
**Remove**: Prerequisite checks

## Key Benefits

### 1. Perfect Separation
- No responsibility overlap between tags
- Each tag has exactly ONE clear purpose
- Dependencies are minimal and explicit

### 2. Lost in the Middle Solution
- Each orchestration tag is 30-100 lines
- Document tags with templates are naturally longer
- Flat structure enables pinpoint referencing

### 3. Slash Command Optimization
Commands can reference only needed tags:
- `/hm:requirements` → patterns, workflows, nudges, requirements
- `/hm:investigate` → patterns, workflows, gates, investigation
- `/hm:design` → patterns, workflows, gates, design

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear where to add new features
- Obvious where to find existing logic
- Natural extension points

### 5. Cognitive Clarity
- 10 tags is manageable cognitive load
- Each tag name clearly indicates its purpose
- Layer structure provides mental model

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Create `<kiro-principles>` by extracting from scattered locations
2. **Phase 2**: Create `<kiro-workflows>` by merging timing + operations
3. **Phase 3**: Clean document tags by removing orchestration logic
4. **Phase 4**: Validate no duplication remains

## Conclusion

This structure achieves the optimal balance between:
- **Granularity**: Not too many tags (cognitive overhead)
- **Separation**: Not too few tags (mixed responsibilities)
- **Clarity**: Each tag has ONE clear purpose
- **Completeness**: All existing functionality is preserved

The key insight was recognizing that workflows (timing + operations) are inherently coupled and should be kept together, while validation gates are a separate concern. This gives us exactly 10 tags with perfect separation of concerns.
