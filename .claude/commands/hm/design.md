# /hm:design - Technical Design Generator

## Triggers
- Requirements document needs technical design specification
- Architecture decisions require documentation
- Implementation planning from business requirements
- Design review or update of existing specifications

## Usage
```
/hm:design [--simple]
```
- `--simple`: Use simplified design template for small changes

## Key Patterns
- **Document Selection**: <kiro_requirements> exists ‚Üí Detailed Template
- **Document Selection**: No requirements + complex needs ‚Üí Detailed Template
- **Document Selection**: No requirements + simple needs ‚Üí Simple Template
- **Complexity Detection**: Complex requirements ‚Üí Activate all architect agents
- **Domain Detection**: Backend-heavy ‚Üí backend-architect, UI-heavy ‚Üí frontend-architect
- **Scale Detection**: System-wide ‚Üí system-architect activation
- **Investigation Constraint**: Design phase ‚Üí No file editing by agents

## Boundaries
**Will:**
- Generate technical design documents from requirements
- Leverage specialized architect agents for comprehensive analysis
- Read existing code to understand patterns and conventions
- Support iterative design refinement
- Document all files and modifications for review
- Think in English, document in Japanese

**Will Not:**
- Estimate implementation time or effort
- Include release procedures or deployment steps
- Replace requirements gathering or investigation phases
- Make business or product decisions

## Tool Coordination
**Claude Code Tools:**
- **Read**: Load <kiro_design>, <kiro_requirements>, <kiro_investigation>
- **Write/MultiEdit**: Save design document progressively (main command only)
- **Task**: Launch specialized architect agents when complexity requires

**Agent Integration:**
- **backend-architect**: API design, database architecture, security patterns
- **frontend-architect**: UI components, accessibility, performance optimization
- **system-architect**: System boundaries, scalability, technology selection

## Document Templates

### Detailed Design Document Template
````markdown
## Meta
- **Completeness**: [0-100%]
- **Requirements**: [Brief requirements summary]
- **Architecture Scope**: [Backend/Frontend/Full-stack]

## Overview
[As-Is/To-Be overview]

## Design
[Comprehensive description of changes; which files to modify and how]

### [Target File 1: path/to/file1.ts]
[Current issues or gaps to be addressed]
[Post-modification state and additions]

```typescript
// Complete code showing the desired final state
// Include all necessary changes and implementations
```

### [Target File 2: path/to/file2.py]
[Current issues or gaps to be addressed]
[Post-modification state and additions]

```python
# Complete code showing the desired final state
# Include all necessary changes and implementations
```

### [Target File 3: path/to/new-file.js] (New File)
[Purpose and rationale for this new file]

```javascript
// Complete implementation of the new file
```

## Completeness Scoring Rule
- 0-30%: Overview and file identification
- 30-60%: Detailed modifications per file
- 60-80%: Complete code examples
- 80-100%: Ready for implementation

## Behavioral Flow

1. **Initialize & Assessment**: Load existing documents and analyze current state
   - Read <kiro_design>, <kiro_requirements>, <kiro_investigation>

   **State Assessment and Next Actions:**
   - No requirements, no design ‚Üí Ask: "Please provide requirements for design:"
   - Requirements exist, no design ‚Üí Ask: "Create design document from requirements? [Y/n]:"
   - No requirements, design exists ‚Üí Ask: "What's next? (update/investigate/questions/implement):"
   - Both exist ‚Üí Ask: "What's next? (update/investigate/questions/implement/done):"

   **[STOP HERE AND WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE - DO NOT PROCEED]**

2. **Design Strategy Planning**: Determine architecture approach based on complexity

   **Complexity Assessment:**
   - Simple feature (single layer) ‚Üí Direct design generation
   - Medium complexity (2 layers) ‚Üí Activate relevant architects
   - High complexity (full-stack) ‚Üí **All three architects in parallel**

   **If architect agents needed:**
   - Display: "üèóÔ∏è Launching architecture analysis with specialized agents..."
   - Execute parallel Task agents as described in Key behaviors

3. **Document Generation**: Create/update design document
   - Select template based on complexity (Detailed vs Simple)
   - If agents were used: Aggregate and synthesize recommendations
   - Resolve conflicts between domain recommendations
   - Ensure consistency across all architectural layers

4. **Review Loop**: Present design and iterate based on feedback
   - Display generated design document with completeness score
   - Ask: "Is this design acceptable? [Y/n] or provide modifications:"

   **[STOP HERE AND WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE - DO NOT PROCEED]**

   - If "Y" or Enter ‚Üí Save to <kiro_design> and proceed
   - If "n" or modifications requested:
     * Analyze if feedback requires additional investigation
     * If investigation needed ‚Üí Use Grep/Glob/Read to gather specific information
     * If simple clarification ‚Üí Update with existing knowledge
     * Regenerate design incorporating new findings
     * Return to step 4 for re-review

5. **Finalization**: Save and suggest next steps
   - Write final design to <kiro_design>
   - Display: "‚úÖ Design document saved (Completeness: XX%)"
   - Suggest next actions:
     - If needs investigation: "Run `/hm:investigate --for design` for technical details"
     - If ready: "Proceed with implementation"

Key behaviors:
- **Architect Specialization**: Each agent focuses on their domain expertise
- **Parallel Execution**: When needed, launch multiple subagents in parallel for comprehensive analysis
  - **Execute Parallel Investigation**: Launch approved Task agents
  - **[The implementation will send multiple Task tool calls in one response]**
  - Each agent operates **independently** with its own investigation context
  - Agents process **concurrently** without dependencies
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Design evolves through iterations
- **Completeness Tracking**: Display design maturity percentage

## Examples

### Example 1: Full-Stack Design with Architects
