.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml                  # Workspace root configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ crates/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hail-mary/              # Main application crate

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Project Configuration (`.kiro/config.toml`)

```toml
[[steering.types]]
name = "product"
purpose = "Product overview and value proposition"
criteria = [
    "Product Overview: Brief description of what the product is",
    "Core Features: Bulleted list of main capabilities",
    "Target Use Case: Specific scenarios the product addresses",
    "Key Value Proposition: Unique benefits and differentiators",
]
allowed_operations = ["refresh", "discover"]  # Default for core types

[[steering.types]]
name = "tech"
purpose = "Technical stack and development environment"
criteria = [
    "Architecture: High-level system design",
    "Development Environment: Required tools and setup",
    "Common Commands: Frequently used development commands",
]
allowed_operations = ["refresh", "discover"]  # Default for core types

[[steering.types]]
name = "structure"
purpose = "Code organization and project structure patterns"
criteria = [
    "Root Directory Organization: Top-level structure",
    "Code Organization Patterns: How code is structured",
    "Key Architectural Principles: Core design decisions",
]
allowed_operations = ["refresh", "discover"]  # Default for core types

[[steering.types]]
name = "principles"
purpose = "Core project principles"
criteria = [
    "Design Principles: Fundamental design decisions",
    "Development Guidelines: Code quality standards",
]
allowed_operations = []  # Manual updates only
```

### Steering System Types

- **`product`**: Product overview, features, and value proposition documentation
- **`tech`**: Technology stack, development environment, and command reference
- **`structure`**: Code organization, architectural patterns, and structural decisions

### Update Strategy Control

Each steering type includes an `allowed_operations` property that controls automatic updates:

- **`["refresh", "discover"]`** - Update existing info and add new discoveries (default for product, tech, structure)
- **`["refresh"]`** - Only update existing information
- **`["discover"]`** - Only add new discoveries
- **`[]`** - Manual updates only via `/hm:steering-remember`

### File System Organization

The steering system uses git-trackable markdown files:
- `.kiro/steering/product.md`: Product context (always loaded)
- `.kiro/steering/tech.md`: Technical context (always loaded)
- `.kiro/steering/structure.md`: Structural context (always loaded)

## üîå Claude Code Integration

### System Prompt Integration

Hail-mary integrates with Claude Code through structured system prompts that provide specification context:

```xml
<kiro_spec_name>my-feature</kiro_spec_name>
<kiro_spec_path>.kiro/specs/2024-03-15-my-feature/</kiro_spec_path>
<kiro_requirements>.kiro/specs/2024-03-15-my-feature/requirements.md</kiro_requirements>
<kiro_design>.kiro/specs/2024-03-15-my-feature/design.md</kiro_design>
<kiro_tasks>.kiro/specs/2024-03-15-my-feature/tasks.md</kiro_tasks>
<kiro_memo>.kiro/specs/2024-03-15-my-feature/memo.md</kiro_memo>
<kiro_investigation>.kiro/specs/2024-03-15-my-feature/investigation.md</kiro_investigation>
```

### Custom Slash Commands

Hail-mary provides custom Claude Code slash commands in `.claude/commands/hm/`:

- `/hm:steering`: Main steering management command - updates and maintains steering files
- `/hm:steering-remember [title]`: Capture learning and insights directly to steering files  
- `/hm:steering-merge`: Advanced merging of steering content with conflict resolution

### Steering System Context

The steering system provides always-available context to Claude Code sessions:
- **product.md**: Loaded automatically for business context in all sessions
- **tech.md**: Loaded automatically for technical stack awareness
- **structure.md**: Loaded automatically for architectural pattern consistency

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Hail-Mary follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    CLI[CLI Interface] --> CMD[Command Layer]
    CMD --> UC[Use Case Layer]
    UC --> REPO[Repository Layer]
    REPO --> INFRA[Infrastructure Layer]
```

For detailed architectural documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](.kiro/steering/structure.md).

### Key Components

- **CLI Interface**: Clap-based command routing with structured arguments and shell completions
- **Use Case Layer**: Business logic with validation for project and specification management
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted file system operations through trait interfaces
- **Domain Model**: Rich domain entities for project configuration and steering system
- **Infrastructure Layer**: File system operations, process management, and TUI components

## üìö Documentation

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](.kiro/steering/structure.md)**: Detailed system architecture and design patterns
- **API Documentation**: Run `just doc` to generate and open Rust documentation
- **Steering Files**: `.kiro/steering/` contains project context documentation

### Specification Management Workflow

1. **Initialize**: Set up `.kiro` directory and steering system with `hail-mary init`
2. **Create**: Generate new feature specifications with `hail-mary new <feature-name>`
3. **Develop**: Work on features in `.kiro/specs/<date-feature-name>/` directories
4. **Integrate**: Use `hail-mary code` to launch Claude Code with specification context
5. **Complete**: Use interactive TUI with `hail-mary complete` to mark specs as done
6. **Archive**: Completed specs are moved to `.kiro/archive/` for reference

### Steering System Workflow

1. **Capture**: Use `/hm:steering-remember` during Claude Code sessions to save insights (ignores `allowed_operations`)
2. **Maintain**: Run `/hm:steering` to update and refresh steering files (respects `allowed_operations` settings)
3. **Configure**: Edit `allowed_operations` in config.toml to control which files can be automatically updated
4. **Version Control**: Commit steering changes to share context with team members
5. **Context Loading**: Steering files automatically provide persistent context for development

## üîí Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all boundaries
- **Path Safety**: Secure file system operations with proper validation
- **File System Security**: Safe file operations with permission checks
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data exposure in error messages

```bash
# Run security audit
just audit
```

## üìä Performance

- **File System Efficiency**: Optimized path resolution and file operations
- **Process Management**: TTY-aware process launching with minimal overhead
- **Template Generation**: Efficient string handling and minimal allocations
- **Configuration Caching**: TOML parsing optimization for repeated access
