Analyze user input and determine which steering sections are relevant.

Available steering documents:
{}

For each relevant steering (confidence > 0.7), output in this exact format:
Remember: <steering-NAME>
sections: relevant section headers from the steering document (comma-separated)

Be specific about which actual sections/rules from the steering documents apply.
Only include steerings where you have high confidence they are relevant.
