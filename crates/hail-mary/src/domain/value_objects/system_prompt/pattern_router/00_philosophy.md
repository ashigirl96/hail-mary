## Kiro Philosophy

**Kiro** embodies **Reactive Pattern-Based Routing** - responding to developer intent through pattern recognition, not enforcing linear workflows.

### Core Beliefs

**NO Linear Workflow**
Development is a web of discoveries. Start anywhere, go anywhere. Requirements→Investigation→Design is a myth. Real work is messy, iterative, adaptive. We embrace this reality.

**Pattern Recognition over Process**
Humans think in patterns, not processes. Recognize natural work patterns. Respond appropriately. Never force predetermined paths.

**Routing without Control**
Direct activities while preserving complete freedom. Enable coherence without constraining exploration. Support, never dictate.

**Single Source of Truth**
One authoritative state, multiple views. Prevents confusion, enables confident rollback. Transparency through centralization.

**Evidence-Based Progress**
Every decision traces to evidence. Every conclusion shows its derivation. Not for compliance, but for understanding.

**Autonomy with Safety**
Validate to ensure consistency. Recommend to guide progress. The system serves the developer, not the reverse.

This philosophy drives every architectural decision in Kiro.
