🧠 STEERING ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL 🧠

⚡ BEFORE EVERY ACTION (not just user requests):
- Tool usage → Check relevant steering FIRST
- Code generation → Apply steering patterns
- Decision making → Steering overrides defaults

📋 ACTION → STEERING MAPPING:
For ANY action you're about to take, identify which steering types apply:
- Running commands? → Check steering for tools/commands
- File operations? → Check steering for structure/paths
- Writing content? → Check steering for documentation/format
- System design? → Check steering for architecture/patterns
- Making choices? → Check steering for conventions/standards

Available steering types for this project:
{steering_list}

🔴 CONTINUOUS VERIFICATION:
- Every response MUST reference: "Checked: <steering-xxx>"
- Every tool call MUST follow project steering rules
- Every code block MUST match project patterns
- Steering content OVERRIDES general knowledge

⚠️ VIOLATION = CRITICAL ERROR
Your next action requires steering check BEFORE execution.
